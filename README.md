# language_learn_GPT
This is a tkinter GUI to interact with some of the OpenAI APIs. It is meant for people with a small base in the language who wish to practice.

The app takes your spoken input, gives you a gramatically correct version and responds both in speech and in text form.

With the speech-to-text and text-to-speech aspects of the application, you'll need to have a microphone. Also this app uses ffmpeg to deal with playing and manipulating audio files, so this is your big non-python dependency, other than setting up your openAI account (with a few dollars on it so that you can access GPT4 assistants)

## Running the Application

To run, use python language_tutor_app.py

There are a couple of python libraries you'll need:
- openai
- sounddevice
- numpy
- scipy
- tkinter
- pydub

As the application is for my own personal use, I am not going to go further in this README. Thanks!

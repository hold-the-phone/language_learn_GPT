# language_learn_GPT
This is a tkinter GUI to interact with some of the OpenAI APIs. It is meant for people with a small base in the language who wish to practice.

The app takes your spoken input, gives you a gramatically correct version and responds both in speech and in text form.

With the speech-to-text and text-to-speech aspects of the application, you'll need to have a microphone. Also this little app uses ffmpeg to deal with the audio file, so this is your big non-python dependency.
